# Sorting Visualizer

Explore and understand the dynamics of sorting algorithms in real-time with the Sorting Visualizer. This web application provides an interactive way to visualize the step-by-step execution of various sorting algorithms, allowing you to witness how algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort arrange elements to achieve an ordered sequence.

Adjustable array sizes and animation speeds provide flexibility, enabling you to tailor the visualization to your preferences. The visual representation of sorting algorithms offers insights into their efficiency and behavior, making it an educational tool for those interested in algorithms and computer science concepts.

Built with Astro for optimized performance and React for a responsive user interface, the Sorting Visualizer ensures a smooth and engaging experience. Take a dynamic journey through the world of sorting algorithms, gaining a deeper understanding of their inner workings.
